        <h1>Privacy Policy for Learn AI</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 27, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Learn AI mobile application (the "Service") provided by bigberri ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information you provide to us directly:</strong> For account creation and management, we use a third-party service, Clerk. Through Clerk, we may collect your name, email address, and password. This information is used to create and secure your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong> When you use the Service, we automatically collect information about your activity, such as your lesson progress and quiz results. This is used to save your progress and personalize your learning experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>
            <li>Allow you to create an account and save your learning progress.</li>
            <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our Service.</li>
            <li>Understand and analyze how you use our Service.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that help us operate our Service. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clerk:</strong> For user authentication and account management. You can view their privacy policy here: <a href="https://clerk.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://clerk.com/privacy</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Online Payments</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not accept or process any payments online.</strong> The Learn AI application is free to use, and does not contain any features for purchases or financial transactions. Therefore, we do not collect any payment or credit card information, and we do not use any payment vendors.</p>
